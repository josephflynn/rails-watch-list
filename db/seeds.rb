# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# require 'faker'

# puts "Cleaning database..."
# Movie.destroy_all
# List.destroy_all
# Bookmark.destroy_all

# puts "Creating restaurants..."

# 20.times do |movie|
#   movie = Movie.create(title: Faker::Movie.title , overview: Faker::Movie.quote, rating: rand(1..10))
#   puts "Created #{movie.name}"
# end
# puts "Finished creating movies!"

# 5.times do |list|
#   list = List.create(name: Faker::Music.genre)
# end

# puts "Finished creating lists(genres)..."

# 40.times do |review|
#   review = Review.create(rating: rand(1..5), content: Faker::Restaurant.review, restaurant: Restaurant.all.sample)
#   puts "Created #{review.rating}"
# end
# puts "All Done!"
